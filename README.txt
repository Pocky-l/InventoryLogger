Hello! This mod is written for Forge and is designed to prevent you from losing your items in unexpected situations. However, the modification does not fully protect you from such situations, but only allows you to load your or someone else's inventory backup.

Here are some commands that will help you find and load the necessary inventory:

/inventory set [player] [date] - rolls back the player's inventory to the specified date (yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm-ss)
/inventory list [player] <date> - returns a list of dates on which the inventory can be backed up, the date can be incomplete, for example: 2023-03, will return all dates for this month.

Enjoy the game! Special thanks to GamePoint.SU.
